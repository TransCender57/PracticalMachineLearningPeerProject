Week 4 Peer Assignment for Practical Machine Learning
=====================================================

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Introduction

This assignment explores data collected from a personal activity monitoring
device. People regularly quantify how much of an activity they do, but
rarely to they qualify how well they do it. The analysis below attempts to
answer that question.

The data for this analysis comes from [Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)
[also see @Velloso2013.] and contains data from accelerometers on the
belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of six (6) participants. They were asked
to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in five (5) different
ways. This project will predict how well the participant did the exercise
(represented by the classe variable in the data set) from the accelerometer
data.
